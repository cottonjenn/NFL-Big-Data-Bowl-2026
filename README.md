 ## Ideas of relationships to predict player movement
- type of play
- most common formations
- top routes
- interaction of location on the field and score to where they will be

## Vision of professors 
- for predictive competition, dr page want to throw a neural net at the data first and see what we come up with then feature engineer (edit interactions and explanatory variables) from there to predict better
- i ran a random forest but after 11 hours of running i quit it, so i'll try something else lol

## What we need done now
- fully explore the data (EDA and play by play animations for specific week or team to understand player movement details in relation to our variables)
  - focus on coverage for defense, offense, and position
  - include geospatial sphere for predictions?
- spend time thinking and researching of the prompt (what have people already done? what has been found? what is known and not known?)
- look at current submissions for analytics and predictions competition and see what they are doing
- **tracking data** = think differently about statistics that you have ever before

Look at these links for help on visualization and animation:
